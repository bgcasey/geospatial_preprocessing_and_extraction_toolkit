#   Shared configuration for all GEE Python scripts in
#   this folder. Set EE_PROJECT to your Google Cloud
#   project ID registered for Earth Engine. Find it in
#   the Code Editor (code.earthengine.google.com, profile
#   icon, top right) or register a project at
#   code.earthengine.google.com/register.
#
#   Scripts pick this up automatically via
#   utils.gee_utils.initialize_ee().
