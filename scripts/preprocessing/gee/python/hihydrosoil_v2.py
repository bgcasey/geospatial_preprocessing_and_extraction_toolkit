# title:   HiHydroSoil v2.0 Layers Export
# author:  Brendan Casey
# created: 2026-07-10
# inputs:
#   - HiHydroSoil v2.0 ImageCollections
#     (FutureWater / sat-io)
#   - Hydrologic_Soil_Group_250m Image
#     (FutureWater / sat-io)
#   - Alberta boundary (FAO GAUL level1)
#   - XY points asset (may include locations outside AB)
# outputs:
#   - Multiband HiHydroSoil images clipped to Alberta,
#     exported at native (~250 m) and 1000 m resolution.
#   - Per-batch CSVs of point-level extracted values.
# notes:
#   HiHydroSoil v2.0 provides global soil hydraulic
#   properties at 250 m, derived from SoilGrids250m v2.0
#   by FutureWater. Most continuous layers are stored as
#   int16 * 10000 and are rescaled to physical units by
#   multiplying by 0.0001. The Soil Texture Class (stc)
#   and Hydrologic Soil Group (HSG) layers are
#   categorical and are exported without rescaling.
#
#   Most assets are ImageCollections representing the six
#   standard soil depths. They are collapsed to a
#   multiband image using .toBands(), producing band
#   names of the form <index>_<asset>. The
#   Hydrologic_Soil_Group_250m asset is a single Image.
#
#   1000 m exports use ee.Reducer.mean() for continuous
#   layers and ee.Reducer.mode() for categorical layers
#   (STC, HSG) to avoid producing meaningless averages of
#   class codes.

#   Then set EE_PROJECT in _gee_config.py to your
